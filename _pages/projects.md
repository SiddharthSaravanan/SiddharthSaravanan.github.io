**Segmentation Algorithms for High Resolution Images**<br />
May 2021 - Present<br />
BITS Pilani, K K Birla Goa Campus Goa, India<br />
· Supervisor: Professor Sravan Danda, BITS Pilani, K K Birla Goa Campus.<br />
· Used morphological operations and Random Walker algorithm to perform image segmentation on High
Resolution Images.<br />

**ML/GAN Based algorithms for Remote Sensing and Cross Spectral Image Matching**<br />
January - May 2021<br />
BITS Pilani, K K Birla Goa Campus Goa, India<br />
· Supervisor: Professor Nitin Sharma, BITS Pilani, K K Birla Goa Campus.<br />
· Developed a pipeline involving a GAN and a CNN which was capable of performing accurate image
registration on non-registered cross-spectral, remote sensing images.<br />

**Composition and Rendering of Bharatanatyam Performance**<br />
August 2020 - May 2021<br />
BITS Pilani, K K Birla Goa Campus Goa, India<br />
· Supervisor: Professor Ramprasad S. Joshi, BITS Pilani, K K Birla Goa Campus.<br />
· Created human animations of a dancer performing the Indian dance form ”Bharatanatyam”. Used
Blender and its Python API to create animations given a list of 30-dimensional vector codes.<br />

**Machine Learning Algorithms for Structural Health Monitoring**<br />
May - June 2020<br />
CSIR-CEERI, Pilani Pilani, India<br />
· Supervisors: Dr Kota Solomon Raju, Senior Principal Scientist, Dr Gaurav Purohit, Scientist.<br />
· Used Convolutional Neural Networks and Artificial Neural Networks to predict the structural integrity
of a building using data recorded by accelerometers placed on adjacent floors of the structure.<br />
