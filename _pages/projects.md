**Segmentation Algorithms for High Resolution Images** May 2021 - Present
BITS Pilani, K K Birla Goa Campus Goa, India
· Supervisor: Professor Sravan Danda, BITS Pilani, K K Birla Goa Campus.
· Used morphological operations and Random Walker algorithm to perform image segmentation on High
Resolution Images.

**ML/GAN Based algorithms for Remote Sensing and Cross Spectral Image Matching**
January - May 2021
BITS Pilani, K K Birla Goa Campus Goa, India
· Supervisor: Professor Nitin Sharma, BITS Pilani, K K Birla Goa Campus.
· Developed a pipeline involving a GAN and a CNN which was capable of performing accurate image
registration on non-registered cross-spectral, remote sensing images.

**Composition and Rendering of Bharatanatyam Performance** August 2020 - May 2021
BITS Pilani, K K Birla Goa Campus Goa, India
· Supervisor: Professor Ramprasad S. Joshi, BITS Pilani, K K Birla Goa Campus.
· Created human animations of a dancer performing the Indian dance form ”Bharatanatyam”. Used
Blender and its Python API to create animations given a list of 30-dimensional vector codes.

**Machine Learning Algorithms for Structural Health Monitoring** May - June 2020
CSIR-CEERI, Pilani Pilani, India
· Supervisors: Dr Kota Solomon Raju, Senior Principal Scientist,
· Dr Gaurav Purohit, Scientist.
· Used Convolutional Neural Networks and Artificial Neural Networks to predict the structural integrity
of a building using data recorded by accelerometers placed on adjacent floors of the structure.
