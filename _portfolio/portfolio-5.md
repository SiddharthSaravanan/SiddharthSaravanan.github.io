In this work we create a Deep Learning model capable of registering optical and microwave remote sensing images of the same scene.<br\>
Shown below is the pipeline of our model.

We give the microwave and optical images of the same scene as input and the model generates as output a list of pairs of coordinates. Say, for example, that one of the pairs in the list is \[M : (120; 121), O : (500; 512)\]. This means that the algorithm detected a feature in the neighbourhood of coordinate (120; 121) in the microwave image and that its corresponding feature in the optical image was detected in the neighbourhood of coordinate (500; 512). Having a list of such matches gives us matching features and key points between the optical and microwave images that can be used for co-registration of the images.

The first part of the pipeline which is called the "Microwave Image Generator" is a GAN that is capable of taking an optical image and producing its corresponding microwave image.

In the figure shown below, image (a) is an example optical image, image (b) is the microwave image that was generated by the GAN and image (c) is the ground truth microwave image of the same scene of image (a).

We do this as we can yield better results when we compare a generated microwave and the input microwave image rather than a the input optical and input microwave image directly.

Next, we pass both the generated and input microwave images into the "Image Matching Network". This network is a CNN that is capable finding matching features between two images, as shown below.

We then remove some of the matches based on angles...
