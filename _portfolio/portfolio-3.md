The objective of this project is to use Machine Learning algorithms to determine the structural health of a building. More precisely, the objective was to take noisy accelerometer data from accelerometers placed on two adjacent floors of a building and accurately predict the status of the building. We used ML algorithms to take two noisy accelerometer readings and output an array that accurately represents the structural health of the structure.
